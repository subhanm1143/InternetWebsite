                <h3>Customer Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Every year, we conduct extensive nationwide surveys, asking customers to evaluate their ISPs across multiple dimensions, including reliability, value for money, and customer service interactions. This feedback not only influences our rankings but also highlights the factors that matter most to users.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Internet Plan Index</h3>
                <p>
